        <h2 class="inner-subtitle">Question about a topic?</h2>
        <p class="inner-text">Answer about the topic is below.. there is always one fundamental moment that we all go back to. That is that very first moment that we went out where you could really see the cosmos well and you took in the night sky. For city dwellers, this is a revelation as profound as if we discovered aliens living among us. Most of us have no idea the vast panorama of lights that dot a clear night sky when there are no city lights to interfere with the view.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-li">
        <h2 class="inner-subtitle">Sure we all love the enhanced? </h2>
        <p class="inner-text">But I bet you can remember as a child that very first time you saw the fully displayed clear night sky with all the amazing constellations, meters and comets moving about and an exposure of dots of light far to numerous to ever count.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-li">
        <h2 class="inner-subtitle">The best way to recapture the wonder </h2>
        <p class="inner-text">of that moment is to go out in the country with a child of your own or one who has never had this experience and be there at that moment when they gaze up and say that very powerful word that is the only one that can summarize the feelings they are having viewing that magnificent sky. That word is ‚Äì ‚ÄúWow‚Äù.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-li">
        <h2 class="inner-subtitle">Probably the most phenomenal fact</h2>
        <p class="inner-text">about what that child is looking at that is also the thing that is most difficult for them to grasp is the sheer enormity of what is above them and what it represents. The very fact that almost certainly, virtually every dot up there in the sky is another star or celestial body that is vastly larger that Earth itself, not by twice or ten times but by factors of hundreds and thousands, can be a mind blowing idea to kids. Children have enough trouble imagining the size of earth itself, much less something on such a grand scope as outer space.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="faq-li">
        <h2 class="inner-subtitle">But when it comes to astronomy?</h2>
        <p class="inner-text">we do better when we fall into deeper and deeper levels of awe at what we see up there in the night sky. Some amazing facts about what the children are looking at can add to the goose bumps they are already having as they gaze eyes skyward. Facts like‚Ä¶</p>
